随着我在IMS(国际数理统计学会)的主席任期行将结束，成为“前任主席”之际，我开始回顾我为学会吸纳新成员作出的努力。正如[IMS官网](http://imstat.org/)所述：“IMS的宗旨在于促进数理统计理论与应用的发展和传播”。伴随数据科学的出现，同时概率论和统计学在数据科学中扮演者越来越出众的角色，IMS能否吸引更多的成员变得至关重要。尤其是在诸如统计，应用数学，计算机科学，电子工程和其他数据科学相关学科行将获得学历的人才，都将成为IMS的关注对象。对于这些充满朝气的年轻人而言，他们有一大部分职业生涯会在本职工作岗位，而另一部分将会是在诸如IMS的专业领域社区中与同行相互协作。

As I am finishing my term as the IMS President and transitioning into the role of Past-President, I have been reflecting on the roles of IMS in an effort to attract new members into IMS. As stated at the IMS website ([http://imstat.org/](http://imstat.org/)), “The purpose of this institute is to foster the development and dissemination of the theory and applications of statistics and probability”. With the emergence of data science and the eminent role of probabilistic and statistical thinking and training in data science, it is important for IMS to attract more members, especially young people who are getting their degrees in statistics, probability, applied mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering, and other data science related fields. For such young people, a big part of their professional life after degree will be at their work place, but another big part is through professional societies such as IMS.

那么到底IMS是什么样的组织呢？回忆一下IMS是怎么开始其历程将会对我们认识它有很大帮助。Annals of mathematical statistics(数理统计年刊)起源于1930年。随后的1935年，在密歇根大学统计系教授Carver的努力下促成了IMS独立于ASA(美国统计协会)组建，以帮助统计学家建立联系的纽带。1938年，年刊的编委会由诸多重量级统计学者组成，Wilks (编辑), Fisher, Neyman, Hotelling, Pearson, Darmois, Craig, Deming, von Mises, Rietz, Shewhart均在其列。1973年期刊被分为两部分，一者为Annals of Statistics(统计学年刊)，一者为Annals of Probability(概率论年刊)。Statistical Science(统计科学),Annals of Applied Probability(应用概率论年刊), Annals of Applied Statistics(应用统计学年刊)随后才有。此外IMS也助力其他期刊和学术组织，诸如ElectronicJournal of Probability(概率论电子期刊), the Electronic Journal of Statistics(统计学电子期刊), the Journal ofComputational and Graphical Statistics(计算机及图形统计期刊), Probability Surveys(概率论与统计调查), and Statistics Surveys(统计学与统计调查)。**从一开始，IMS的重点就落在高质量的期刊上。今天，IMS已经承载更多任务，他为举办主要学术峰会和颁发概率论与统计学领域重要奖项扮演着关键的角色。**

What is IMS? It is good to remember how IMS began. In fact, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics started in 1930 before IMS became an organization in 1935 in an effort by Carver (Professor of Statistics at University of Michigan) to have a home for mathematical statisticians separate from ASA. In 1938, the editorial board of the Annals consisted of Wilks (editor), Fisher, Neyman, Hotelling, Pearson, Darmois, Craig, Deming, von Mises, Rietz, Shewhart. The Annals was split into The Annals of Statistics and The Annals of Probability in 1973. Statistical Science, The Annals of Applied Probability, and The Annals of Applied Statistics were added later. In addition IMS cosponsors several journals with other societies like the Electronic￼Journal of Probability, the Electronic Journal of Statistics, the Journal of￼Computational and Graphical Statistics, Probability Surveys, and Statistics Surveys. **From the very beginning, high-quality journals have been a central part of IMS. Today, IMS is much more. It runs major conferences and gives major awards in statistics and probability.**

IMS是一个跨越五大洲的人才交流网络，约有4000名来自美洲，欧洲，亚洲，大洋洲，非洲的成员参与其中。在经济全球化的大背景下，IMS的影响力以及稳健成长的趋势给予成员一个跨越文化和地域交流研究成果的平台。近期一次调查在4,561名活跃成员中同时展开，其中1,492人予以回应。在参与调查的人当中，61.1%来自北美，20.0%来自欧洲，12.5%laizi yazhou ,3.4%来自大洋洲， 1.7%来自非洲，1.3%来自南美；80.0%是男性，20.0%是女性；53.2%的人填选了统计学（作为自己的关注重点），47.3%选择应用统计学，14.3%选择概率论，还有11.6选择了（应用概率论）（关于此调查的更多信息请查阅IMS财务官员Jean Opsomer所著的关于本议题的报告）。绝大部分组织成员均为各层级的志愿者，包括现任的，往任和即将到任的主席，理事和委员。IMS的财务预算精简而有效，并为执行主管支付薪酬。

IMS is a cross-continent human network of about 4000 members from North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and South America. With the globalization of the world economy, the fact that IMS is cross-continent and moderately sized gives its members a huge advantage for meeting professionals from other cultures and places. A recent member survey was sent to all 4,561 active members at that time, and 1,492 responded. Among the respondents, 61.1% are from North America, 20.0% from Europe, 12.5% from Asia, 3.4% from Oceania, 1.7% from Africa, and 1.3% from South America; 80.0% male and 20.0% female; 53.2% checked the box of statistics, 47.3% for applied statistics while 14.3% for probability and 11.6% for applied statistics (more information about the survey can be found in the article by IMS Treasurer Jean Opsomer in this issue of Bulletin). Most of IMS organization colleagues are volunteers including the President, Past President and President- Elect, Council and committee members. IMS runs on a lean and effective budget, with a paid executive director.

论起最不可或缺的“洲际人际交流网络”当属IMS主要期刊背后的编委会成员。IMS的主席每年都会提名1／3的IMS组委会成员，其中包括出版委员会以及为IMS文章指定合著者的编辑筛选委员。各刊物的编辑会指定协助编辑同推荐人共同合作。包括总编辑和负责实际印刷的VTex同事在内的志愿者构成了IMS的支持幕僚。**IMS刊物的读者可以回复编委会成为推荐人，然后成为一个协助编辑。能提供高质实时举荐的推荐人会被列入协助作者的候选名单。从职业生涯发展来说，成为协助编辑很有价值：一来读者在自身从事的领域中受到“学术快递”的启发，再者读者会慢慢学会如何写出更好的文章，学会如何从协助编辑的反馈中评价作者的研究成果。**很多时候同事之间在未正式见面之前就有可能相互领教过对方撰写的论文了。值得注意的是，无论是在业界或者在学术界，能够以公平和清晰的价值尺度衡量他人的学术成果是至关重要得综合能力。(诸如人才招聘，终身教职评估以及奖项提名等都涉及相关的能力。)

One indispensable (cross-continent) human network of IMS is people who are behind its premier journals. Every year, the IMS President appoints 1/3 members of IMS committees, including the publication committee (general policy), and the editor selection committee that appoints editors or co-editors for IMS journals. Journal editors appoint associate editors who then work with referees. The IMS support staff include the managing editor and VTex colleagues who do the actual printing. **As readers of IMS journals, one could give back by working as referees and later as associate editors. Good-quality and timely referee reports put one on the list of potential associate editors. There are many other values added to a referee at a professional level: one gets inspired by ideas in the new papers refereed (often related to one's own research interests), one learns how to write papers better and how to evaluate others' works with feedback from associate editors, and one meets colleagues on paper first before meeting them in person.** It is worth noting that evaluating others' works in a fair and articulate manner is an important and integral part of a senior person's job in both industry and academia (e.g. hiring, and tenure reviews and award/recognition nominations).

其次重要的“洲际人际交流网络”则是IMS会议幕后的那些优秀成员。在每次会议上，统计学人才济济一堂，得以面对面的交流心得。每四年IMS都会在北美之外组织一次年度盛会（2014年在悉尼）。在其他年份，IMS则是与其他社团合作举办会议：奇数年举办联合统计会议（JSM），每个能被4整除的年份则是和伯努利协会举办世界会议（World Congress，2016年在多伦多）。另外一个重要的会议是IMS新研究者会议，每年在JSM大会之前召开（2014年在波士顿）。而且，IMS主办、协办许多其他会议，包括偶数年份的JSM和每年都有的随机过程及应用会议（2014年在布宜诺斯艾利斯）。IMS任命其组委会成员。IMS的会员可以通过为会议做贡献的方法参加组织的管理。一个年轻的研究者可以借此机会来组织他感兴趣的会议、邀请其他的研究者并和他们会面。对于研究者而言，这既是他们他们提升自身在这个社区中存在感的机会，更能在研究交流中碰撞出思维的火花，并与那些潜在的合作者、推荐信的作者一一会面。
The second indispensable (and cross-continent) human network of IMS is the people who are behind IMS conferences where people communicate and exchange ideas and meet colleagues in person. Every 4 years the IMS organizes its Annual meeting outside North America (2014 in Sydney). In other years it is joint with￼other societies, in odd years at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) and every year ￼divisible by 4 at the World Congress, together with Bernoulli Society (2016 in￼Toronto). An important meeting is the IMS New Researchers Conference, whic h￼takes place each year immediately before the JSM (2014 in Boston). In addition IMS￼sponsors and cosponsors a large number of other meetings, among them the JSM in￼even years and the Conference on Stochastic Processes and its Applications (2014 in￼Buenos Aires, every year). IMS appoints organization committee members. IMS members could participate in the organization by proposing invited and contributed Sessions. **A young researcher could use this opportunity to organize sessions of interest to him/her and meet other researchers by inviting them. This is an opportunity to raise one's visibility in the community, obtain new ideas for research and teaching, and meet in person potential collaborators and reference letter writers.**

第三重要的人际交流网络是IMS的委员会。委员会由IMS主席通过参考前任主席和理事会的意见任命的。
The third human network of IMS is through the IMS committees, which are appointed by the IMS president in consultation with the Past President and President Elect (with possible suggestions from the Council).

国际数理统计学会颁发若干荣誉奖项，如Wald讲座、Neyman讲座、Rietz讲座、Le Cam讲座，以及八个荣誉奖章讲座。**对于许多大学中的晋升或升职，这些奖项是受到高度认可和重视的，并且通常是获得超越常规认可与加薪的基础。此外，对于大学中各个级别的评价和擢升，专业服务都是考量因素，而对于资深教员，校方通常也要求其在专业团体中担任领导角色。要逐渐步入领导角色，在IMS委员会、理事会或IMS期刊进行服务是第一步，而加入IMS委员会需要会员资格。**

IMS gives prestigious awards such as Wald, Neyman, Rietz, and Le Cam and eight Medallion Lectures. **For advancements/promotions in many universities, these awards are highly recognized and valued and often are the basis for more than normal recognitions and salary increases. Moreover, professional service is expected for reviews and promotions in universities at all levels, and leadership in professional societies is often expected for senior faculty members. To ease into leadership roles in IMS, serving on IMS committees or council, or on editorial boards of IMS journals is a first step and IMS committees require membership.**

对于有着共同兴趣的人群，IMS拥有特别兴趣小组的组织架构（[http://imstat.org/groups/](http://imstat.org/groups/)）来让IMS内部形成小的人际网络。以这个关于金融的活跃小组为例，它在每年举办一次会议（[http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~xinguo/FPS/](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~xinguo/FPS/)）；而另外两个类似于小组的IMS社团是国际数理统计学会中国分会（IMS-China）和亚洲与环太平洋地区分会（IMS-Asia Pacific Rim），它们定期在相应的地区举办会议。国际数理统计学会也与伯努利学会（[http://www.bernoulli-society.org/](http://www.bernoulli-society.org/)）以及国际贝叶斯分析协会（ISBA）（[http://bayesian.org/](http://bayesian.org/)）提供联合会员资格。

For a group of people with a shared interest, IMS has a special interest group structure ([http://imstat.org/groups/](http://imstat.org/groups/)) to allow a small human network form within IMS. Such an active group is on finance and it holds a conference every year ([http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~xinguo/FPS/](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~xinguo/FPS/)) and two other group-like IMS communities are IMS-China and IMS-Asia Pacific Rim, which hold regular conferences in the respective regions. IMS also offer joint memberships with Bernoulli Society ([http://www.bernoulli-society.org/](http://www.bernoulli-society.org/)) and International Society of Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) ([http://bayesian.org/](http://bayesian.org/)).

总而言之，在信息技术的时代，我们职业生活中的重要决策依然是由人做出的（比如，是否接收文章、雇佣、授奖、授予终身教职）。人际网络在今天较以往任何时候正在变得更加重要，或者说至关重要，因为我们总是被过量的信息所淹没。在我看来，对于需要高效使用的有限数量的时间和精力来说，换言之，例如，决定去阅读哪些论文和去听哪些报告，可信赖的人的观点是我们最佳的导引。通过国际数理统计学会的会议、委员会、编辑部，以及小组，我们可以遇到合作者、潜在的审稿人、（在招聘会上遇到）未来的雇主——这些人都是潜在的评估者（例如，评审终身教职、写升职信的人），正因如此，他们可以引领我们迎接世界范围内的就业机会。

In summary, in the age of information technology, important decisions in our professional life are still made by humans (e.g. paper acceptance, hiring, grant awards, tenure decision). Human network is becoming more important or vital now than ever also because we are flooded with information. Trusted human opinions, in my view, are the best guides for us to use efficiently the finite amount of time and energy, that is, to decide on which papers to read and what talks to go to, for example. Through IMS conferences, committees, editorial boards, and IMS groups, one meets collaborators, potential reviewers, future employers (at job fairs) -- these people are potential evaluators (e.g. tenure reviews, promotion letter writers) and they could lead to job opportunities worldwide.

IMS为全球所有该领域研究者提供了人性化、自然化的交流网络。加入IMS会让你的学习研究更加美好！IMS对于学生完全免费。对于新毕业生和一些在由IMS理事会确认的国家长期居住的人们，IMS会提供折扣优惠。([http://imstat.org/membership/designated_countries.htm](http://imstat.org/membership/designated_countries.htm)).
**IMS provides a premier human network of global nature. Join IMS and make it even better! It is free for students, and￼reduced rates for new graduates and for people with permanent residence in a number of countries designated by￼the IMS Council ([http://imstat.org/membership/designated_countries.htm](http://imstat.org/membership/designated_countries.htm)).

在离开之前，我想提醒大家一个关于荣誉演讲的提名过程的激动人心的变化：从2015年开始，组委会将对其会员开放演讲的提名。详情请见http://imstat.org/awards/lectures/nominations.htm](http://imstat.org/awards/lectures/nominations.htm。而且，IMS已经和NISS、ASA一道在2014年的JSM上赞助NISS-ASA-IMS写作研讨会（其中半天专门为母语非英语的演讲者准备）。我们期待在2015年的JSM上看到相似的研讨会。
Before signing off, I would like to bring your attention to an exciting change of nomination process for named and medallion lectures: starting in 2015, the committee will be open to nominations from its membership (see [http://imstat.org/awards/lectures/nominations.htm](http://imstat.org/awards/lectures/nominations.htm) for more information). Moreover, IMS has joined NISS and ASA to sponsor a NISS-ASA-IMS Writing Workshop at 2014 JSM (with a special half day for non-native speakers) and we expect a similar workshop at 2015 JSM.
